This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the community or its projects.

## 🚨 **Enforcement**

### **Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### **Enforcement Guidelines**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem to be a violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### **1. Correction**
**Community Impact**: Using gentle incorrect language
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### **2. Warning**
**Community Impact**: A single incident of inappropriate behavior
**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### **3. Temporary Ban**
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, and no use of community platforms or resources. For violations of this level, it is not appropriate to assign people to watch over the banned user.

#### **4. Permanent Ban**
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals
**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public or private communication with the community, including collaboration on community projects or use of community platforms and resources.
